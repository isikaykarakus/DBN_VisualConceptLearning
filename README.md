# Deep Belief Network for Visual Concept Learning
# Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a Deep Belief Network (DBN) for visual concept learning using the EMNIST dataset. The project aims to explore computational models of visual concept learning through simulations, with a focus on unsupervised generative models.

# Project Objectives
The main objectives of the project include:

# Perform Linear Read-Outs:
Investigate the disentanglement of sensory representations at different levels of the DBN hierarchy.

# Analyze Internal Representations:
Utilize hierarchical clustering and feature visualization methods to analyze the internal representations developed by the model.

# Visualize Confusion Matrices and Psychometric Curves:
Create confusion matrices and psychometric curves to understand the model's error patterns, especially under the influence of added noise.

# Explore Adversarial Attacks and Few-Shot Learning:
Examine the model's response to adversarial attacks and its capability in few-shot learning scenarios.

# Clearly Explain Implementation Details:
Provide a detailed explanation of the DBN architecture, training and testing methodologies, and motivate the choices made. Critically discuss the results in the context of the course topics.

# Introduction
The objective is to train and test a Deep Belief Network on the EMNIST dataset to uncover meaningful features. Unlike traditional classifiers, this DBN relies on unsupervised learning, constructing a hierarchy of features without the need for labeled data.

# Implementation Details
# Model Architecture
The DBN combines generative models with a readout layer. Generative models capture patterns and statistical regularities, while the readout layer extracts valuable information from the generative model's output.

# Training Methodology
The model is trained on the EMNIST dataset, leveraging concepts from class practical sessions and lab materials for Cognition and Computation course.
